# Platypus-DOS: Based on DFC-DOS based on MS-DOS v2.0
This repo contains the source-code and compiled binaries for Platypus DOS v1.0, which will be used in Platypus OS

# Source
This is based on the source code from Microsoft's open sourced versions of [MS-DOS](https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS) and the [fork created by DamieFC](https://github.com/DamieFC/DFC-DOS).

## Contribute!
The source files in this repo are up for development! If you want to contribute, I could have some help with the following (but please leave some of the additional comments and typos, they're funny!): 

1. Adding interenet connection
2. Adding drivers for USB, Aux, and anything else more modern
3. Heck, why not add a GUI (Instead of Windows, Panes?...)!

(Also, I don't know any Assembly language, so... that is a problem.)
